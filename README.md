# IB-QRG
IB QRG "Quick Reference Guide" resources website. For EGR23 use.

## The IB Quick Reference Guide is a central location for all important IB information, including exam and paper dates, details about assignments, etc. **At the moment, this is not a study guide.**

Updates made to the site are done manually, with the source code pasted onto the host server. Please don't do this-- I don't know what I'm doing.
